### Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`git init`  - creates a new Git repository

`git status` - inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area

`git add` - adds files from the working directory to the staging area

`git diff` - shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area

`git commit` - permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository

`git log` - shows a list of all previous commits
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*how to backtrack*

`git checkout HEAD filename` - Discards changes in the working directory.

`git reset HEAD filename` - Unstages file changes in the staging area.

`git reset commit_SHA` - Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*git branching*

`git branch` - Lists all a Git projectâ€™s branches.

`git branch branch_name` - Creates a new branch.

`git checkout branch_name` - Used to switch from one branch to another.

`git merge branch_name` - Used to join file changes from one branch to another.

`git branch -d branch_name` - Deletes the branch specified.
