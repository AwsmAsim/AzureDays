# Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning using Microsoft Azure ‚ú®
  
### We will be showing how you can clean the data and create a simple ML model using Azure notebooks and you will aslo explore the power of Azure ML Studio! üòé   
The best part I love about Azure ML studio is, I can create a Machine Learning model using a simple flow. And not only this, It's so easy to use the trained ML model as a web service. üòç
  
One question for everyone would be: Have you ever wanted to predict the future? ü§î

I would say, **YESSSS!!** (Obviously Yes!!!)  
Well, if correlating, predictions can be related to Machine Learning. As machine learns to predict based on the previous data.  
  
So, properly saying, __Machine Learning is the branch where the machine learns from the data in order to preform some analysis. We can say like Handwritten Digit Recognition, Credit-card fraud detection, Face detection, and so on.__  

Some basic types for Machine Learning can be:
1. Supervised Learning:  
  - Regression
  - Classification
2. Unsupervised Learning:
  - Clustering  
 
__ML is mostly about making predicitons based on historical data.__  

Whereas, **Data science is all about gaining the insights from the data, finding patterns, and which actions we can perform.**  

Some ML in action can be seen at:
1. [How-old.net](How-old.net)
2. [Akinator] (https://en.akinator.com/)
3. And so on.

This is how Machine Learning grow with Microsoft. <br/>

Talking about challenges and advancement in the ML & AI, one can look at:

And if someone look for the process behind Machine Learning, this is the process which can be easily seen:
